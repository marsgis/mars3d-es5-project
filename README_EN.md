## What is Mars3D
>  `Mars3D platform` is [Mars technology](http://marsgis.cn/) a 3D client development platform based on WebGL technology, which is based on [Cesium](https://cesium.com/cesiumjs/) optimization and B / S architecture design,The lightweight and efficient GIS development platform supporting multi industry expansion can run efficiently in the browser without installation and plug-ins, and can quickly access and use a variety of GIS data and three-dimensional models, present the visualization of three-dimensional space, and complete the flexible application of the platform in different industries.

 > Mars3d platform can be used to build 3D GIS applications without plug-ins, across operating systems and across browsers. The platform uses WebGL for hardware accelerated graphics, and realizes real dynamic big data 3D visualization across platforms and browsers. The Mars3D product can quickly realize beautiful and smooth 3D map presentation and spatial analysis on browsers and mobile terminals.
